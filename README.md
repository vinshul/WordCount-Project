WordCount-Project
=================

This project is a related to tweaked version of the traditional WordCount Example in MapReduce.

The Goals of this project are:

-->Given TWO textual files, count the number of words that are
common (using the naïve scheme – 4 Mapreduce stages).

-->Read multiple input files in MapReduce.

-->Write programs that involve multiple stages.

-->Perform a task that combine information from two files.
